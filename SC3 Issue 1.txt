 Issue: 1| Lobby dupe | Keep map
 We've all been at the lobby at
 some point, because of a restart
 or a slow internet connection,
 but with the help of Emmaknijn
 and PC_Cat, we'll be able to
 visit the lobby at any time!
 This is because of the start of
 a recreation of the lobby, using
 a schematic created on Jan 8th.
 We hope their efforts don't go
 to waste!
